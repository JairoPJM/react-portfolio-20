				Hey there, I'm Jairo, and I'm excited to share my portfolio webpage with you! Right now, I'm learning web development in a bootcamp program. In my free time, I run my own interior painting business. However, I've always been a fan of computers, and I've decided to change my career path and pursue web development full-time. It's something I'm passionate about, and I'm excited to see where this new journey takes me. Thank you for checking out my portfolio!
